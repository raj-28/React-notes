React JS Setup
==============
What if you want to create a React application from the scratch?

1. You can use Create React app using npm
	npx create-react-app kitchen-sink
			or
	npm install -g create-react-app@17
	create-react-app kitchen-sink
   
   The above commands
    create a live development server, 
	use Webpack to automatically compile React, JSX, and ES6, 
	auto-prefix CSS files, and 
	use ESLint to test and warn about mistakes in the code
   
2. Once that finishes installing, move to the newly created directory and start the project.
	cd my-app
	npm start
   
Once you run this command, a new window will popup at localhost:3000 with your new React app.

Files and Folders
-----------------
Inside the project structure, you’ll see 
	/public and /src directory
	regular node_modules, .gitignore, README.md, and package.json.

The /src directory will contain all our React code. In /public, our important file is index.html, which is very similar to the static index.html file we made earlier – just a root div. This time, no libraries or scripts are being loaded in. 

Have a look at index.js and App.js files.

Once you edit and save the files, localhost:3000 compiles and refreshes with the new data --> hot reload.
