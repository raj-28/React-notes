Unmounting phase
++++++++++++++++
The last phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting, as React likes to call it. React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:
    a.componentWillUnmount(){...}
		is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.
		
This is the place for performing any necessary cleanup, e.g., any subscription which was created in componentDidMount(). A component can be unmounted from DOM using ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode() or when you move to a different view.

1. Update code of Tester to:
	...

	export default class Tester extends Component {
	  ...
	  componentDidMount() {
		this.secondsCounter = setInterval(this.startTimer, 1000);
	  }

	  /**
	   * tear down the timer when the component is no longer
	   * in use
	   */
	  componentWillUnmount() {
		clearInterval(this.secondsCounter);
		alert("Tester will unmount...");
	  }

	  render() {
		return (
		  ...
		);
	  }
	}
